# Description

> Created by: [Mikkel Schmidt](https://github.com/miklschmidt)

A cable chain carriage mount and frame anchor for the [10x20 TANCUDER drag chain found on amazon.de](https://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B07VGC8QJR/)

The EVA carriage mount part replaces the Universal Cable Mount for the EVA Back. You will need 3x M3x10mm and 3 M3 hex nuts for attaching the mount to the EVA back.

You might need another hole pattern for your particular drag chain, if you adapt this design or create a new one, please submit it via pull request! Step files are at the bottom of this page.
