# EVA / Contrib

This is a EVA repository for the community to share their parts that are not neccessarily 100% compatible with the EVA standard - i.e. a part that only works with a certain version of EVA / BMG.

This is also a place to share other things like spool holders, test prints, etc.

To submit something you need to issue a pull request here: https://github.com/EVA-3D/contrib-extras/pulls.

If you need help with your submission please ask for help here: [Rat Rig Unofficial Discord Server](https://discord.gg/DcCEk8u).

Please! Share your candy!
